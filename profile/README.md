# Welcome to AppThrust
## About AppThrust
AppThrust is developing a cutting-edge platform designed to empower developers by simplifying the deployment and management of applications on their own cloud environments, similar to services like Heroku and Vercel. Our goal is to streamline the process from development to deployment, making it faster, more reliable, and cost-effective.

## Our Mission
The demand for software is growing globally, and with it, the expectations for speed, quality, and functionality in app development are also increasing. AppThrust aims to address the challenges developers face — from deploying applications to managing infrastructure — so they can focus more on innovation rather than operations.

## Are these hindering your projects?

In the rapidly evolving world of software development, many teams face significant challenges that impede their progress. These pain points not only slow down development cycles but also add unnecessary complexity and costs. AppThrust aims to alleviate these common issues by providing a streamlined platform that simplifies the entire development and deployment process. Below are specific challenges that developers and companies frequently encounter:

- **Infrastructure Setup and Maintenance Costs:** Building and updating the infrastructure environment on AWS or GCP, and verifying its operation are too costly and time-consuming.
- **Deployment Verification:** Spending excessive time ensuring that applications are running correctly in production environments.
- **Release Speed:** Uncertainty about whether new versions will perform correctly in production slows down the release process.
- **Security and Safety Concerns:** Spending too much time verifying the security of applications, infrastructure, and cloud services.
- **Serverless Complexity:** Using AWS serverless services to ensure security and scalability does not provide a satisfactory development experience.
- **Regional Limitations with Heroku:** Being unable to choose your preferred AWS region when using Heroku.
- **Connectivity Issues with Vercel:** Unable to connect to local databases when using Vercel.
- **PaaS Restrictions:** Unable to deploy PaaS on your own AWS, limiting control over data and asset management.
- **Kubernetes Cost and Maintenance:** The expense and effort of setting up and maintaining Kubernetes on AWS are prohibitive.

## Key Features
- **Custom Infrastructure on AWS and GCP:** Quickly set up a ready-to-use infrastructure that's robust and scalable.
- **Kubernetes-based Platform:** Leverage the full power of Kubernetes without the need for extensive in-house expertise. Create production-grade Kubernetes clusters on AWS in moments.
- **Cost Optimization:** Like serverless architectures, our platform ensures that resources are used only when needed, reducing costs.
- **Build & Deploy:** Seamless integration with your code repositories for easy build and deployment processes.
- **Traffic Control & Monitoring:** Gradually roll out updates with traffic control for new revisions, ensuring stability before full deployment.

## Future Vision
With your feedback, AppThrust will continuously improve, aligning our platform to better meet the needs of developers worldwide. We're committed to enhancing the development lifecycle, making it as efficient and stress-free as possible.
